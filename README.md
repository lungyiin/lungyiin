### 👋 Hi, I'm Chris
I'm a final year LLB Student at the University of Southampton ⛴. My research interests include Data Protection 💾 and Internet Regulation 🌐.

In my professional life, I work as a Legal Engineer ⚖️💻 at SYKE. I'm a self-taught Web Developer and write apps in node, PHP and Python. I'm interesting in contributing to technology projects that support access to justice.

I'm passionate about improving access to the legal profession for students from non-selective state school backgrounds. In my spare time, I volunteer at STRIVE, a city law access scheme. I'm a member of the Society for Computers and Law (SCL) D&I Committee and help run SCL Student Bytes.

After the successful completion of my LLB and LPC, I'll be joining Clifford Chance as a Trainee Solicitor on the IGNITE pathway in 2022.
